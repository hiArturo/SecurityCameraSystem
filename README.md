# SecurityCameraSystem
Summer Break 2022 Personal Project

Created a security camera system with Python and OpenCV library that works with most cameras' video streaming protocols\
Used the face-recognition library to do facial recognition from a given set of images of people's faces\
When it detects a face or a body moving it automatically starts recording until the person is out the frame\
This recorded video is stored locally on the computer in the same folder of the project\
